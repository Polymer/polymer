## Brief Overview

For more detailed info go to [http://polymer-project.org/](http://polymer-project.org/).

Polymer is a new type of library for the web, designed to leverage the existing browser infrastructure to provide the encapsulation and extendability currently only available in JS libraries.

Polymer is based on a set of future technologies, including [Shadow DOM](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webcomponents/raw-file/tip/spec/shadow/index.html), [Custom Elements](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webcomponents/raw-file/tip/spec/custom/index.html) and Model Driven Views. Currently these technologies are implemented as polyfills or shims, but as browsers adopt these features natively, the platform code that drives Polymer evacipates, leaving only the value-adds.

## Tools & Testing

For running tests or building minified files, consult the [tooling information](http://www.polymer-project.org/resources/tooling-strategy.html).

## Development Mode

This repository contains the concatenated and minified form of the Polymer core libraries. The original source is located at [Polymer/polymer-dev](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-dev).

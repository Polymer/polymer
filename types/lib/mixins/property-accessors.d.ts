  /**
   * Element class mixin that provides basic meta-programming for creating one
   * or more property accessors (getter/setter pair) that enqueue an async
   * (batched) `_propertiesChanged` callback.
   *
   * For basic usage of this mixin:
   *
   * -   Declare attributes to observe via the standard `static get observedAttributes()`. Use
   *     `dash-case` attribute names to represent `camelCase` property names.
   * -   Implement the `_propertiesChanged` callback on the class.
   * -   Call `MyClass.createPropertiesForAttributes()` **once** on the class to generate
   *     property accessors for each observed attribute. This must be called before the first
   *     instance is created, for example, by calling it before calling `customElements.define`.
   *     It can also be called lazily from the element's `constructor`, as long as it's guarded so
   *     that the call is only made once, when the first instance is created.
   * -   Call `this._enableProperties()` in the element's `connectedCallback` to enable
   *     the accessors.
   *
   * Any `observedAttributes` will automatically be
   * deserialized via `attributeChangedCallback` and set to the associated
   * property using `dash-case`-to-`camelCase` convention.

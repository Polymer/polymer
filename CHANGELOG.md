- * Improve clarity: change `__dataInitialized` to `__dataReady` * When `_flushClients` is called, ensure that clients are always enabled or flushed as appropriate. This ensures that (1) clients that are enabled before the host is enabled flush properly, and (2) clients that are stamped but not enabled properly enable when the host flushes. ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/8e8692f7))

- Fix typo in  runBindingEffect documentation ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/6bd8dcfa))

- Fixes #4601. Client elements can be readied that have already enabled properties. This can happen when templatize is used to create instances with no properties. In this case, in order for properties to flush properly to clients, clients must be flushed. ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/06df53d9))

## [v2.0.0-rc.1](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/tree/v2.0.0-rc.1) (2017-03-06)

<!-- the changelog tool broke, so this is ported from https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/docs/release-notes#v-2-0-0-rc.1 -->
The following notable changes have been made since the 2.0 Preview announcement.

-   The `config` getter on element classes has been replaced by individual `properties` and
    `observers` getters, more closely resembling the 1.x syntax.

    ```js
    static get properties() {
      return {
        aProp: String,
        bProp: Number
      }
    }
    static get observers() {
      return [
        '_observeStuff(aProp,bProp)'
      ]
    }
    ```

-   1.x-style dirty checking has been reinstated for better performance. An optional mixin is
    available for elements to skip dirty checking of objects and arrays, which may be more easy to
    integrate with some state management systems. For details, see
    [Using the MutableData mixin](devguide/data-system#mutable-data) in Data system concepts.

-   Support for dynamically-created `custom-style` elements has been added.

-   Support for the external style sheet syntax, `<link rel="import" type="css">` has
    been added. This was deprecated in 1.x, but will be retained until an alternate solution is
    available for importing unprocessed CSS.

-   New properties `rootPath` and `basePath` were added to `Polymer.Element` to allow authors
    to configure how URLs are rewritten inside templates. For details, see the
    [Update URLs in templates](./upgrade#urls-in-templates) in the Upgrade guide.

## [v1.9.0-dev](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/tree/v1.9.0-dev) (2017-04-13)
- [ci skip] skip looking in build log, again ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/1d282c7f))

- [ci skip] backport changelog fixes ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/d6a7ac71))

- * allow setting `rootPath` * disallow setting `importPath` (this is supported in 2.x but not 1.x) ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/ac067652))

- Add `importPath` and `rootPath` to support 2.x hybrid compatible elements. ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/daaf460a))

- [ci skip] Update comment to include reference to problem browser. ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/72f21fe6))

- Check documentElement instead of body to guarantee it's there. ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/a0ad3bbe))

- add tests ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/20de9287))

- Adds a setting `preserveStyleIncludes` which, when used with a shadow dom targeted css build and native custom properties, will copy styles into the Shadow DOM template rather than collapsing them into a single style. This will (1) allow the browser to optimize parsing of shared styles because they remain intact, (2) reduce the size of the css build resources when shared styles are used since they are not pre-collapsed. This option does perform registration runtime work to add included styles to element templates. ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/2315547e))

- Fix test failures by feature detecting instance `properties` accessors. Can't rely on `__proto__` on IE10, but that browser doesn't need to avoid `properties`. ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/f2a12cb1))

- Prevent annotator from removing the `is-inert` attribute. ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/91925148))

- fixes for users of Polymer.Class ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/0f53bef4))

- Add support for `isInert` to allow elements to boot up in an inert state. e.g. `<x-foo is-inert></x-foo>`. Setting `xFoo.isInert = false` causes the element to boot up. ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/ca3f59d3))

- Fix tests on IE10 and simplify constructor shortcut. ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/e588f1f5))

- Make dom-module work on older Safari. ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/73b62a63))

- micro-optimizations: (1) favor mixin over extends where possible, (2) unroll behavior lifecycle calls, (3) avoid creating a custom constructor when not used, (4) provide `_skipDefineProperty` setting on behaviors which copies properties via assignment rather than `copyOwnProperty` ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/a1c1285d))

- Ensure done. ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/08753237))

- Test positive case of suppressBindingNotifications ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/1b19b784))

- Add notifyDomBind to dom-bind. ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/ad7f91d6))

- Revert unnecessary change. ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/dcde6d4c))

- Fix test lint issue. ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/26c669ce))

- Add global flags to suppress unnecessary notification events. Fixes #4262. * `Polymer.Settings.suppressTemplateNotifications `- disables `dom-change` and `rendered-item-count` events from `dom-if`, `dom-repeat`, and `don-bind`. Users can opt back into `dom-change` events by setting the `notify-dom-change` attribute (`notifyDomChange: true` property) to `dom-if`/`don-repeat` instances. * `Polymer.Settings.suppressBindingNotifications` - disables notify effects when propagating data downward via bindings. Generally these are never useful unless users are explicitly doing something like `<my-el foo="{{foo}} on-foo-changed="{{handleFoo}}">` or calling `addEventListener('foo-changed', ...)` on an element where `foo` is bound (we attempted to make this the default some time back but needed to revert it when we found via https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/3077 that users were indeed doing this).

- Add `forceRegister` flag to force an element to fully register when `Polymer` is called. Normally, some work is deferred until the first element instance is created. ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/d53323d))

- Call registered no prototype. ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/812db6a))

- [ci skip] update changelog ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/98acb3a))

- Fixes #2692. Ensures that custom-style properties are applied async but before next render so that all properties are defined before any are consumed by custom-styles. Also refines dom-module's early upgrade code so that it does not affect other elements (corrects for example, custom-styles upgrading before expected). ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/b829f2a))

- Remove undesired full-stop from outputs ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/68d5c55))

- Explicitly making an element's `_template` falsy is now considered an allowable setting. This means the element stamps no content, doesn't collect any styles, and avoids looking up a dom-module. This helps address #2708 and the 5 elements Polymer registers that have no template have been set with `_template: null`. ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/b905a37))

- Make test work under native Shadow DOM. ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/4f9c2bd))

- In `_notifyListener`, only use `e.detail` if the event has a detail. This is necessary for `::eventName` compatibility where `eventName` is a native event like `change`. ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/3ece552))

- change after render method to `Polymer.RenderStatus.afterNextRender` ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/8949c04))

- When effect values are applied via bindings, use fromAbove gambit to avoid unnecessary wheel spinning. (This is now possible since we have fast lookup for readOnly where we want to avoid doing the set at all). ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/c520907))

- do readOnly check for configured properties where they are handed down, rather than when they are consumed. ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/24bcedb))

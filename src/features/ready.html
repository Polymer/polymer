  /**

    Provides `ready` lifecycle callback which is called parent to child.

    This can be useful in a number of cases. Here are some examples:

    Setting a default property value that should have a side effect: To ensure
    the side effect, an element must set a default value no sooner than
    `created`; however, since `created` flows child to host, this is before the
    host has had a chance to set a property value on the child. The `ready`
    method solves this problem since it's called host to child.

    Dom distribution: To support reprojection efficiently, it's important to
    distribute from host to child in one shot. The `attachedCallback` mostly
    goes in the desired order except for elements that are in dom to start; in
    this case, all children are attached before the host element. Ready also
    addresses this case since it's guaranteed to be called host to child.

  // TODO(sorvell): simply loading this feature incurs a small cost since it
  // hooks attachedCallback. A feature hook at this lifecycle method would
  // allow users to opt out.

  // TODO(sorvell): monkey patch for now.
  var originalAttachedCallback = Base.attachedCallback;

  Base.addFeature({

    // Checks if this element is inside another Polymer element. If so,
    // then pushes this element into an array of `_readyListeners`; if
    // not, starts the notify cascade.
    attachedCallback: function() {
      originalAttachedCallback.call(this);
      this._checkReady();
    },

    _checkReady: function() {
      if (!this._readied) {
        var host = this.queryHost();
        if (host && !host._readied) {
          host._listenReady(this);
        } else {
          this._notifyReady();

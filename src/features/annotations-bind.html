  /*
   * Parses the annotations map created by `annotations` features to perform
   * declarative desugaring.
   *
   * Depends on `annotations` feature and `bind` feature.
   *
   * Two tasks are supported:
   *
   * - nodes with 'id' are described in a virtual annotation map at
   *   registration time. This map is then concretized per instance.
   *
   * - Simple mustache expressions consisting of a single property name
   *   in a `textContent` context are bound using `bind` features
   *   `bindMethod`. In this mode, the bound method is constructed at
   *   registration time, so marshaling is done done via the concretized
   *   `_nodes` at every access.
   *
   *   TODO(sjmiles): ph3ar general confusion between registration and
   *   instance time tasks. Is there a cleaner way to disambiguate?

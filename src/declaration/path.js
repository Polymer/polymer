 /**
  * Resolve a url path to be relative to a `base` url. If unspecified, `base`
  * defaults to the element's ownerDocument url. Can be used to resolve
  * paths from element's in templates loaded in HTMLImports to be relative
  * to the document containing the element. Polymer automatically does this for
  * url attributes in element templates; however, if a url, for
  * example, contains a binding, then `resolvePath` can be used to ensure it is 
  * relative to the element document. For example, in an element's template,
  *
  *     <a href="{{resolvePath(path)}}">Resolved</a>
  * 
  * @method resolvePath
  * @param {string} url Url path to resolve.
  * @param {string} base Optional base url against which to resolve, defaults
  * to the element's ownerDocument url.
  * returns {string} resolved url.

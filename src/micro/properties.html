  /**
   * Define property metadata.
   *
   *     properties: {
   *       <property>: <Type || Object>,
   *       ...
   *     }
   *
   * Example:
   *
   *     properties: {
   *       // `foo` property can be assigned via attribute, will be deserialized to
   *       // the specified data-type. All `properties` properties have this behavior.
   *       foo: String,
   *
   *       // `bar` property has additional behavior specifiers.
   *       //   type: as above, type for (de-)serialization
   *       //   notify: true to send a signal when a value is set to this property
   *       //   reflectToAttribute: true to serialize the property to an attribute
   *       //   readOnly: if true, the property has no setter
   *       bar: {
   *         type: Boolean,
   *         notify: true
   *       }
   *     }
   *
   * By itself the properties feature doesn't do anything but provide property
   * information. Other features use this information to control behavior.
   *
   * The `type` information is used by the `attributes` feature to convert
   * String values in attributes to typed properties. The `bind` feature uses
   * property information to control property access.
   *
   * Marking a property as `notify` causes a change in the property to
   * fire a non-bubbling event called `<property>-changed`. Elements that
   * have enabled two-way binding to the property use this event to
   * observe changes.
   *
   * `readOnly` properties have a getter, but no setter. To set a read-only
   * property, use the private setter method `_set_<property>(value)`.
   *
   * @class base feature: properties

     * Object containing property configuration data, where keys are property
     * names and values are descriptor objects that configure Polymer features
     * for the property.  Valid fields in the property descriptor object are
     * as follows:
     *
     * * `type` - used to determine how to deserialize attribute value strings
     *    to JS properties.  By convention, this field takes a JS constructor
     *    for the type, such as `String` or `Boolean`.
     * * `notify` - when `true`, configures the property to fire a non-bubbling
     *    event called `<property>-changed` for each change to the property.
     *    Elements that have enabled two-way binding to the property use this
     *    event to observe changes.
     * * `readOnly` - when `true` configures the property to have a getter, but
     *    no setter. To set a read-only property, use the private setter method
     *    `_set_<property>(value)`.
     * * `reflectToAttribute` - when `true` configures the property to have a
     *    getter, but no setter. To set a read-only property, use the private
     *    setter method `_set_<property>(value)`.
     * * `observer` - indicates the name of a funciton that should be called
     *    each time the property changes. `e.g.: `observer: 'valueChanged'
     * * `computed` - configures the property to be computed by a computing
     *    function each time one or more dependent properties change.
     *    `e.g.: `computed: 'computeValue(prop1, prop2)'
     *
     * Note: a shorthand may be used for the object descriptor when only the
     * type needs to be specified by using the type as the descriptor directly.

  /**
   * Provides `ready` lifecycle callback which is called parent to child.
   *
   * This can be useful in a number of cases. Here are some examples:
   *
   * Setting a default property value that should have a side effect: To ensure
   * the side effect, an element must set a default value no sooner than
   * `created`; however, since `created` flows child to host, this is before the
   * host has had a chance to set a property value on the child. The `ready`
   * method solves this problem since it's called host to child.
   *
   * Dom distribution: To support reprojection efficiently, it's important to
   * distribute from host to child in one shot. The `attachedCallback` mostly
   * goes in the desired order except for elements that are in dom to start; in
   * this case, all children are attached before the host element. Ready also
   * addresses this case since it's guaranteed to be called host to child.
   *
   * @class standard feature: ready

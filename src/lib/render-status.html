  /*
   * Helper for determining when first render occurs.
   * Call `Polymer.RenderStatus.whenReady(callback)` to be notified when
   * first render occurs or immediately if it has already occured.
   * Note that since HTML Imports are designed to load before rendering, 
   * this call can also be used to guarantee that imports have loaded.
   * This behavior is normalized to function correctly with the HTMLImports
   * polyfill which does not otherwise maintain this rendering guarantee.
   * Querying style and layout data before first render is currently 
   * problematic on some browsers (Blink/Webkit) so this helper can be used
   * to prevent doing so until a safe time.

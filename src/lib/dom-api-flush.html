  /**
   * `Polymer.dom.flush()` causes any asynchronously queued actions to be
   * flushed synchronously. It should be used sparingly as calling it frequently
   * can negatively impact performance since work is often deferred for
   * efficiency. Calling `Polymer.dom.flush()` is useful, for example, when
   * an element has to measure itself and is unsure about the state of its
   * internal or compoased DOM.
